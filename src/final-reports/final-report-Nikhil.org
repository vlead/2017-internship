* About Project(s)
  My project was to rebuild Linux Lab. The requirement was to provide a way for the user to interact with terminal without damaging his system. 
  Hence it provides a terminal emulator on the userâ€™s browser while taking care of security considerations. This lab was based frameworks such as JS, Python, PHP. 
  PHP is used as a scripting language for integrating various servers used in this lab.
