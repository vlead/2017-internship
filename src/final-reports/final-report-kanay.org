* Introduction
  This is the final report of Kanay Gupta
  
* About Project(s)
  My project was to build experiments for the ds-lab which captures the ideas in a much better and comprehensible way. I also had to work on notations and diagrams which could explain the algorithm in a much better way. I made two experiments i.e. merge sort and quick sort based on HTML, java-script and Dagre-d3 based library. I also surveyed and documented several technologies such as processing, p5.js etc. which could come in handy in my project.

* Project Outcome
  - Surveyed various data visualisation tools such as p5,processing,d3 etc.
  - Made 4 experiments based on html and javascript libraries.
  - Each of them depicts different visualisations of sorting algorithms.
  - Quick sort and merge sort are complete with narration and literate code.
  - More sorting algorithms would be converted .
  - A research paper will be published on this topic.
