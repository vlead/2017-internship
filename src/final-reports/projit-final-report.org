* Introduction
  This is the final report of Projit Bandyopadhyay.


* About Project(s)

** Oauth Service 

- Doing a survey of current industrial standards to see what is being used for
authentication and authorization between microservices. I compared systems
using purely JWT(Javascript web tokens) to Oauth systems.
Then we built a model as a proof of concept for the oauth.

** Lab Authoring Tools
- Do a comparative study on available modeling and game software for creating the
tools that we are trying to make.

- Also create the programming model to be used to develop this authoring studio.

- Develop a sample studio

** Web Security

- There is no repository that I can link for this.

Helped Akash write his paper on web security: Modeling and Mitigating Cross
Origin Attacks on Systems using FIM using CORP  


* Project Details

Work log for the projects are [[file:../work-logs/projit.org][here]]

** Oauth Service

My Contributions to this project are:

- Doing a survey on industrial methods [[https://github.com/vlead/oauth-service/blob/development/src/project/findings/survey.org][here]]

- Sample implementation of Oauth Client and App servers [[https://github.com/vlead/oauth-service/tree/development/src/implementation][here]]
[[https://github.com/vlead/oauth-service/blob/development/src/project/documentation.org][documentation]]


** Lab Authoring Tools

My Contributions to this are:

- [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-authoring-tools/blob/development/src/documentation/index.org][Comparative Study]] on current industrial modeling and game softwares

- [[https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13pNFrZ-vR7umE9QmOfWoJXYcaRdRx_jRkHFYJC6oavc/edit?usp=sharing][Programming Model]] for scaling this project. 

- [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-authoring-tools/blob/development/src/implementation/index.org][Sample Studio]] where images can be uploaded and placed anywhere. To use,
  tangle it out and open the html page in the browser.


** Web Security
- Found Vulnerabilities in the logout end points of many sites, which became an
  essential part of the experimentation shown in the paper.

- Conducted many of the experiments used.

- Helped write many parts of the actual paper as well.



* Project Outcome

** Oauth Service

- Oauth 2.0 protocol should be used to implement authorization and
  authentication between the services.
- We must implement the user and server flows ourselves, as there is no out of
  the box solution for this(Oauth servers themselves, however, are available).
- Purely JWT based authentication and authorization should not be used as there
  are many other overheads involved: blacklistinng the tokens at each service
  upon logout, security issues..etc.(mentioned in documentation).
- Shubh went on to implement the oauth flows on a small scale.

** Lab Authoring Tools
- Comparative study can be used by others in the future when trying to create
  similar authoring tools.
- The programming model has been solidified and can be carried forward by
  others who will work on this in the future.
- Set ground work on movement of images/objects in a studio as well as
  uploading them onto the page.
- The work done can be used by those converting labs from flash to javascript,
  or even making new labs in javascript. Those doing so have claimed it takes
  almost 50% of their time to place the objects on the screen accurately. With
  minor modifications to the current studio, we can probably return the
  coordinates of the images and thus directly use them(saving 2-3 days worth time).
