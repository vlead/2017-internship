* Introduction
  This document hols the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] - 
In the morning , we had an introduction session where the team of VLEAD told us about their projects and then later we were assigned projects. 
We worked on setting the developent environment on our machines.
In the afternoon, I have set up Lab Data Service server(LDS) on my machine .
I had set up vagrant VM , so i had to install emacs,git and all the python dependancies again.
After the server was setup, I had gone through different API's and got a clear idea what was happening.
Also, I have gone through the documentation of all the API's which were implemented.

  + [2017-06-02 Fri] -
In the morning, we had a brief standup session for around 15 minutes where
our mentor had tested my understanding on the documentation and also 
cleared few misconceptions and doubts. Later, my mentor explained the 
LDS application in detail (Requirements,Design,Data Model etc).
Then, I have gone through the implementation of all the REST API's
along with the test cases.
Then, I and my teammate then sat and discussed about the implementation 
of login page. The requirements of login page came out to be sessions,
types of roles, user being added by the admin to be able to avail LDS 
services. We have brushed up the implementation of Google OAuth which
we have decided to use for the login page.  


** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
   + [2017-06-05 Mon]
     
In the morning we have discussed about the reuirements and data model of LDS. 
We made a clear idea as on how to proceed further. Also, my project manager
gave a milestone that is to be reached by friday. We have implemented 
Google authorisation and Authentication. Sign in and Sign out were working 
properly. We also started writing the backend for users. We created 2 tables
,one for users and one for roles. We have implemented routes like Add User,
Add role,Show users and show roles.
