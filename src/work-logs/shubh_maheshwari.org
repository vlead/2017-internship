   + [2017-06-15 Thu] - Had an interactive talk with Venkatesh Chopellla Sir and Thirumal Sir
   			about the static model of the alloy and how we can use object oriented programming as a methodology.
   			
	  	      - Hence we defined universal sets for all these objects and added specific fields which define an object relation with other objeccts.

	  	      - The static model was made again with the perspective of OOP and hence we defined relations that exist only in the State and also the cardinality constrains were added seprately

	  	       - In the evening we talked again with both of our mentors and discussed about various topics Like:argby (Alloy extension for Ruby),Program Synthesis,SDN,Use of alloy for the Cluster Networkds in VLEAD.

   		      - Added Session to various fields such as state and various predicates such as addUser,deleteUser and showUser.

		      - A new factor (adder,deleter) was added to these predicates to show who added or deleted the User in our model.

		      - Meet with Venkatesh Sir and Thirumal Sir about the various application of modelling which can be:
			1. Using the model for more pratical cases like the OutReach Portal
			2. Using the model to check the security protocals 
			3. Making a model for the AWS cluster of VLEAD
   
   + [2017-06-20 Tue] - Together with Anirudh made some fixes in our web-app-short-course model and added login and logout.

    	              - I also started working on the outReach portal,which could be said as a more complex and pratical case of the web-app-short-course model.

   		      - Added Session, various Roles (NC,OC,Guest,Reviewer).Also added Workshops in outReachPortal model.

   + [2017-06-21 Wed] - Started Reading about the CORP model made by Akash.

   		      - Learned how the Authentication works and how malacious Cross-Origin Attack can be stopped by CORP model suggested by Akash.
		      
		      - Started my research to find a vulnerable instance of a Cross-Origin Attack which could be showed in our model.
 
		      - Had an important discussion with Akash on how he wants the model to work.
			1.Basically we want 2 models one with CORP and one without CORP.
			2.PreCorp(model without Corp) should have a malicious cross origin attack from the attacker Server. 
			
		     - Started work on the PreCorp model.
		       1.Added various Servers,Browser Tabs and HTTP Protocols
		       2.Introduced the concept of State to show the model at diffrent instances.
   
   + [2017-06-22 Thu] - Had an interactive talk with Akash where we discusses his previous alloy models and how they could be used to make the PreCorp Model
     
                      - Added various objects to the PreCorp model
			Status:to keep note of all types of authentication and whether the Cross-Origin Attack was successful.
			HTTPTransaction:the HTTP GET and POST requests were shown for diffrent Servers
			
		      - Made various Predicates such as IDPAuthentication,SPAuthentication,Cross-Origin Attack
			
	  	      - Together with the above mentioned algorithm we succesfully made a PreCorp Model

	  	      - We watched 2 very intresting TEDx talks on adding Computation thinking basic Curriculum and how physicists see Computer Science.

   + [2017-06-23 Fri] - Showed the PreCorp model to the Venkatesh Sir

		      - Started the work on the post Corp model 
     
               
   + [2017-06-24&25 Sat&Sun] 

                      - Added the CORP to the preCorp model.

		      - Added various fields to the State and Corp.Now for every cross-orgin transaction Corp comes into play. 
			
		      - Many Bug fixes were made to get the model running.
			
		      - Improved the structure of the code and also added functions in the model to make it work easily readable and understandable.

		      - Hence  we completed the Post Corp Model

		      - Tried to find the refresh token details eg. the expiry of the access token. Realized the access token take more than 1 hour.In general these tokens take around  

                      - Trying to find errors in the model of Oauth after adding google single-sign on to it. Do to not clear error messages displayed by the system. It is taking longer to debug.

   + [2017-06-14 Fri] - Had a big discussion with Maruthi Sir and Thirumal Sir over the user use of a proxy and an API Gateway to protect all our microservices.

                      - Began learning Zuul (Netflix Api Gateway), this is an open source api and hence we can use it or atleast make a model from this method.

                      - Proxy will safegaurd our network and all the calls will go through the API Gateway.
