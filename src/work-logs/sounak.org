* Introduction
  This document holds the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
*** [2017-06-01 Thu]
+ Set up the working environment that included installing vagrant and setting up a ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machine.
+ Went through the documentation of these repos [[https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform/]] and [[https://github.com/vlead/translators/]].
+ Discussed the project with mentor and teammate.
+ Tried setting up the translator which creates a github repo out of the =json=
  specification using a /Code Skeletal Generator/, but got errors.

** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
** [2017-06-05 Mon]
+ Had a meeting with the mentor regarding goals (milestones) to be achieved in this week.
+ Set up the /Code Skeletal Generator/ or the /Translator/
  ([[https://github.com/vlead/translators/]]).
+ Had to fix some bugs to make the translator work (one of them being the
  space-hiphen inconsistency while creating github repos).
+ Successfully created the repo
  [[https://github.com/test-platform-to-to-deleted/Final-e99233]] from the =json=
  specification using the =create_experiment_lab= API.

+ Also successfully created a tar file from the =json= specification using the
  =create_openedx_lab= API.
+ Tried installing the =dogwood= VirtualBox in Vagrant, but failed.

** [2017-06-06 Tue]
   + Set the OpenEdX Platform release Eucalyptus up in my machine.
   + Hosted the OpenEdX studio and checked whether the =tar.gz= file created by
     the =Translator API= yesterday is compatible with it. It created a course
     successfully in the studio.
   + Fixed this [[https://github.com/vlead/translators/issues/3][issue]] in the translator API.
   + My teammate and I sat with the mentor and set the milestones for this week, which is creating the
     LDS API. 
** [2017-06-07 Wed]
   + Setup the Lab Development Service in developer environment.
   + Wrote the API =/map= in LDS which generates the resource ids for all the section
     of the environment.
** [2017-06-08 Thu]
   + Corrected the code of the =/map= API in and commited it in LDS.
   + Studied about the layers of the code, viz., Object, Persistance, etc.
   + Discussed about Experiment as a Service with the mentor.
