* Introduction
  This document holds the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad.

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] 
     Today the day commenced with the brief introduction of all the projects here at vlead and then
     assignment of our projects. Basic aim was to successfully set Lab Data Service on our
     development environment. In the morning session I setted up my laptop with git, emacs and mysql and then
     in the afternoon following the documentation provided in the repository LDS was setted up and run. I will
     be setting it up again in my virtual machine tonight, since some issues were reported with ubuntu version.
     Along with this Rest APIs were studied and a quick overview of app design was taken using the
     documentation provided in the build folder. 
   + [2017-06-02 Fri]
     The day commenced with the standup of my understanding of the documentation given to be read which was 
     followed by a thorough explaination of the implementation and the documentation by the mentor. Then I tried out
     Rest APIs to get data from the LDS app after going through the documentation once more. Most of the requirements
     regarding implementation of login, logout pages for the LDS were looked upon, noted and discussed. These reqirements
     included usage of sessions, login management, user role and thoughts about databases management. Then various 
     tutorials were studied for implementing OAuth securely (for logins) with in a small personalized flask app and then 
     an app that used Google Auth. and Twitter Auth. were coded and tested just to brush up the concepts learnt. A little 
     reading about schemas, security issues related to OAuth, login managers and different OAuth providers was also done.
** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
   + [2017-06-05 Mon]
     A little change regarding to our approach previously was decided in the morning which then required me 
     to assess the requirements and data model for the lds system again with my mentor and my partner. The 
     morning session was utilized in this task and after this I quickly went back to the assigned issue of 
     creating an app with Google OAuth. Solving many bugs for couple of hours I had it working an hour after
     the lunch. Then time was spent optimizing the code and fixing some of its security flaws along with some 
     testing. Furthermore Design and Data Implementations of Outreach Portal was done in order to help myself 
     with the integration process that should be due for tomorrow. Thus today's issue has been done and now
     documentation is also been provided for today.
   + [2017-07-05 Tue]
     Morning session was spent improving and making the APIs working provided by my partner and thus integrating
     it to our app which already included login and logout apis with Google OAuth. Integration was completed till the 
     afternoon and then all routes were tested using httprequester. Models for app was reviewed from the latest 
     data model provided by the mentor and the APIs just implemented. Then I worked with my partner creating unit
     testcases but we had some problems regarding registering our routes for it. So, unit testing is due tomorrow
     but will tried to be worked till tonight. Further APIs error codes were updated along with some other changes. 
   + [2017-07-06 Wed]
     As decided morning session started with debugging of Unittest codes codes. We were finally able to register all
     the routes by using app's blueprint. Then test cases of all the APIs were written down (each test class has multiple
     test cases) and tested and then with then controllers were also changed accordingly thus code was made more reliable. 
     Documentation regarding testcases were also written. Then in the afternoon session work on errorhandling was looked 
     upon and then redirection were checked. 404 redirection error was finally fixed, fault was found with my jinja code.
     After this we wrote some more html files for the login and index pages. Documentation regarding all of them was
     also written down.
   + [2017-07-07 Thurs]
     Login page, Autherization, 404 pages were written from the scratch today and then bootstrap and css were also implemented 
     to them and Guest and Admin pages were also written and worked upon. Now we have a home page which has a login button in 
     order to go the google auth page and then user is check in the database. Couple of login errors were fixed and 
     JavaScripts were also written. UnitTest cases were updated. Roles were finally integrated in the controllers using sessions 
     which made me to some of the routes and furthermore sending user data to home pages was also implemented in the index home page. 
     In the afternoon final datamodel was reviewed, so I had to implement left out checks in each of the routes to make it fully 
     specify the database model followed. Documentation for APIs were updated and error codes were added. Further styling will be done
     by tomorrow.
   + [2017-06-09 Fri]  
     I worked upon HTML and more CSS, JS whole night which was inregrated today in our codes, changes were also made in to the
     documentation regarding the same. All the routes and Unitest cases were tetsed for the presentation. Multi user login at the same 
     time was tested using many browser and incognito sessions. Changes were made accordingly. Unittesting still needs some attention
     due to extra required admin auth decorator, which I would be tackling tonight. Later part of morning session went in presentation.
     Afternoon session was used to acknowledge the feedback given by other mentors regarding new APIs frameworks such as Jango and
     Swagger. Tutorials and documentation were readed and will be further explored in the weekend. Also tried a bit of angular js as 
     suggested in the feedback. Build still needs some fixing rest works fine, documentation was updated with fixed data structure in
     the evening with my partner.

** Week 3 [2017-06-12 Mon] till [2017-06-18 Sun]
   + [2017-06-12 Mon]
     - Debugging the build failed for the second consecutive day, talked with the mentor; suggestions were implemented, move closer to
       the success.
     - Directory structure was tried to be fixed along with addition for __ini__.py tangle codes to make the directory represented as 
       python modules.
     - Unittesting was worked upon, still needs a way out of the login redirection, need to look at flask session a little more.
     - Angular JS framework was studied and cli was set up and a basic app was deployed and worked upon, made few components, added css. 
       Futher w3 documentations were also studied.
     - PHP was studied and xampp was set up and run inorder to help another intern. Learnt how to access files in htdocs, enabling closing
       services etc. Very basic php scripting was done and tried to viewed through the browser.
     - Plans were made to fix a little bug in controllers, couldn't fix it now so probably will have a look of it again at night.
   + [2017-06-13 Tue]
     - Today finally the build was fixed but test cases began to fail. So I worked upon fixing the test cases.
     - One of the major problems I got during fixing the test cases was bypassing/disabling our custom made route decorators but I cleverly
       found a way to deal with it. Even login decorator problem was fixed. 
     - After the test cases were fixed various changed to app.org was done in order to remove the errors like db and login_user funciton we 
       faced during building the app. Then I worked upon fixing db issue and finally the lgoin_user which was fixed till midnight.
     - Issue was created and worked upon for the review we had on Friday. 
     - In the evening Thirumal sir has explained about the web app short course and asked us to go through it because we will be implementing 
       lds dashboard in a similar way. I will be setting it on my machine today.
     - A talk was attended in the evening on the topic of renarration where we had a little discussion regarding liability and credibility
       when it come reannotate somebody else's work.
     - Currently finding a way to automate certificate generation script and not include them in the main documentation. Will be working on
       this today.
   + [2017-06-14 Wed]
     - Build was fixed again today after I was instructed to export config from rest that included another two hours of heavily changing many things.
     - Databases were shifted from sqllite to MySql for the main app but for the test cases it was was made to stay the same. This was done in order to keep our original database clean. 
     - Everything was tested and work on shell scripts to copy static folder was initiated. 
     - Mentor instructed for a single page application design so web app short course was set up on the machine and then all the codes were read.
     - Instructions were written inorder to run the lds dashboard and all the org files for instructions were updated and then from scratch were tested.
     - Tutorials were shared from another intern in order to help him with his project.
   + [2017-06-15 Thurs]
     - Worked with my mentor debugging the problems with the automated deployment. Had everything fixed till the afternoon and we had our =FIRST RELEASE= here in the evening.
     - Went through the autodeployment scripts in order to understand more about it.
     - Watched some tutorials and and read a book about JSON and Single Page Applications tackling its needs, profits and challanges. 
     - Started work at front end from the scratch. Initial overview seems to work fine. Had faced some problem in dereferencing the HTML object but it was fixed till the evening.
     - Currently wokring on finding appropiate functions in order to get logged in state and sesssion state of current user from the google sign-in documentation. Still haven't got it to work, maybe till midnight it will be done.
     - Test cases were fixed for some errors faced due to the update in the functions of our modals.
   + [2017-06-16 Fri]
     - Worked on checking logged in state of the user with no success. No goole api seemed to work even after sourcing the required stuff. Session cookies didn't work, couldn't really 
       know why. Tried to have a workaround for this but failed. Will look for it in the weekend.
     - We had our presentation where we explained this week's work. I gave insights upon the deployment of the app.
     - Then I attended the tech talk organized which is indeed a great initiative.
     - Read more about single page applications and plus about cookies and thier attributes to find a workaround inorder to create a nav bar with button toggling b/w login and logout on base
       of the session.
     - Did some changed in Rest APIs in order to make it compatible for the SPA structure. 

** Week 4 [2017-06-19 Mon] till [2017-06-25 Sun]
   + [2017-06-19 Mon]
     - Again started working for the workaround. Problem was found in the session cookie, that it carry =HTTPOnly = True= attribute and thus js couldn't read it. So instead I created an ajax call to
       check for the session from server side.
     - Since my partner had trouble making funcions for add role, user; I then worked upon those and all of them were functional till evening. Now only update delete reamins.
     - APIs code was further changed in order for them to support our ajax calls. 
     - Event handlers have been created for buttons and now work will be done regarding hiding the divs and data on pressing of the buttons. 
     - Navbar is ready and data has been now populated on the console, just needs to be exported on the html page which would require a little more change in our APIs.
   + [2017-06-20 Tue]
     - Worked totally on JavaScript today. I wrote almost most of the required event handlers today. These include onClick, onChange event functions.
     - Had a talk with Mentor about the direction of the project. Took note of some very essential guidelines but failed to implement them in the code.
     - Left out AJAX calls will be written tomorrow along with the integration of already written functions of hash routing, window location etc.
     - Fixed a severe bug with our function to create elements using JSON data which included not adding of classes and onclick values. The major problem was they were treated as an attribute for the 
       DOM object when they are not. Seperate condition specification is the provided workaround.
     - Worked on code efficiency, this will continue tomorrow too. Limiting the use of global variables, using various internet resources to find out about the same.
     - Fixed a severe bug with our JSON file that was imported from web-app-short-course. The bug included data types that were not available in JSON format, this was leading to JSON.parse error.
   + [2017-06-21 Wed]
     - I wrote all the event handlers required today. They were tried and tested. Only now thing left is the new update user layout which will take a little more while inorder to have workaround
       in my understanding of tackling the problem.
     - All the AJAX calls were written and tested, I had to change some routes definitions inorder to take a JSON payload. 
     - Finally I integrated whole of the hashrouting, have tested it thoroughly and now everything work regarding the hash routing. I am creating the hashes using id button clicked inorder to make 
       our code more efficient and to enhance strongness of id naming pattern.
     - Most of the bugs I found are now fixed, added few more constraints to APIs definition as discussed in database model discussion today.
     - JSON file has been updated and will be further updated for the new update user layout.
     - Started the work for the documentation regarding the JS file.
   + [2017-06-22 Thur]
     - I implemented couple of major changes in the JS for the changed implementation of the Dashboard by the mentor.
     - New Role and User Update layouts have been now implemented and they are working.
     - Push all the updated codes into the documentation has the code, I will be writing the literate tomorrow.
     - Changes regarding new implementation was put in the JSON and tested.
     - Changed major things regarding hash routing and hash access which arised due to the new implementation. It was
       was tested and it works for now.
     - Wrote a little bit styling for the front-end.
     - Working on Event Listener Persistance bug. No luck till now. 
   + [2017-06-23 Fri]
     - Started working on update profile page plus finally decided to seperate out the side navigation bar from the hardcoded html. Though it was time consuming process but had to be done, in order
       to implement session roles in a better manner.
     - Fixed the bug regarding persistance of the event listener. Had to go through various documentations till I got to know the issue was created due to bubbling in the attachment of the event 
       listener on the document level. Now it works fine.
     - Fixed another major bug regard syntax error at DOCTYPE HTML, which used to be output out in the console whenever I used to navigate to #home. This was caused by an illegal character reference
       in my DOM button element's onclick attribute.
     - Started working on guest dashboard, it need to have only one basic route as of now; which would be update profile.
     - Started documentation, ie. adding literate to my JavaScript finally.
     - Noted out problems still in mind regarding our implementation of the dashboard, marked them in order to discuss them with the mentor. 
** Week 5 [2017-06-27 Tue] till [2017-07-02 Sun]
   + [2017-06-27 Tue]
     - Major Bug fixing was done today which included a bug relating to pre-creating of 'admin' role in our database. This was due to overwriting of database uri in the test cases which 
       I was able to fix today. 
     - Further literal programming was expanded and documentation was continued with.
     - Tangling details of the JavaScript was added and then tested. I carried out heavy changes in both api.org and web-frontend.org in order to prepare for our second release of the
       month.
     - LDS was set up on the system, had some trouble fixing apache2 not running on localhost was able to fix it by defining a global instance of the servername as localhost in apache2.conf.
     - I further started with laying of plans essential for the integration of the code related to AJAX calls for the LDS. Precisely I am finding decent ways to proceed with the integration
       process, which seems a little difficult as of now.
     - Testing of the new and old both AJAX calls were done.
     - Still trying to fix the bug related to access to server routes, discussed this issue in the morning with our mentor and Tirumal sir.
   + [2017-06-28 Wed]
     - Integration with the the main LDS routes started as of today with no success as of such since I am still stuck with cross origin ajax calls.
     - Problems were faced because of CORS in the LDS. More measures will be taken tonight to fix this issue.
     - Access to server routes were fixed with the help of a decorator.
     - Documentation was done for more function in client-side JavaScript and API.
     - Some more bugs were also fixed.
   + [2017-06-29 Thur]
     - I finally was able to call a cross origin ajax call. It took me to add one =before_request= and =after_request= functions in the lds server so that it could handle the ~OPTIONS~ method
       calls and return the requested call with proper headers. 
     - As I fixed cross origin, I started with the integration and was able to integrate all the ~GET~ requests but was again halted at other methods that required authorization.
     - This leads to discussion with Tirumal sir regarding usage of keys in client side JavaScript code or Server routed request, which hasn't been decided since rest of the day was spent 
       finding the most suitable in terms of both security and efficiency. 
     - Later I had to fix all the syntax errors in the JSON specifications my partner was trying to fix since morning with no success. 
     - JSON was changed, fixed and updated.
     - Documentation work was further extended. 
     - =Second Release= was live yesterday, Cheers.
     - Still need to work for finding problems of OAuth on a base4 machine. BUG -> OAuth breaks there.
   + [2017-06-30 Fri]
     - We had a code review session today, morning session was occupied first with preparations regarding code review and then finally by code review itself.
     - In the afternoon session I fixed a logical error in the update user route; which was there due to a simple conditional mistake.
     - Documentation work was increased and further code was documented.
     - Django was taken look into again.
     - Jquery terminal plugins were studied.
     - In the evening I had to attend the TED Talk session organised every friday. 
* Month of July

   + [2017-07-02 Mon]
     - Fixed some more errors with JSON specification.
     - Tried to lay down a new approach which would seperate by front-end and lds server interaction would enable lds-dashboard server to lds server interaction.
     - Wokring on some security fixes.
     - Documentation work was extended, backend for lds-dashboard is not getting the literate template.
     - Tried to write down some universal functions to enable the new approach. No luck till now.
     - Got the data of lds from base4 host for the testing purposes. AJAX call works but security issue asks a new approach.
     - Fixed some error codes based on correct responses in lds server and lds-dashboard server.
   + [2017-07-03 Tue]
     - Work of function has lead to no where.
