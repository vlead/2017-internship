* Project
- Oauth Service ::
In this project I surveyed current industrial standards on authorization and
authentication between microservices, and built a model based on the
interactions in the Oauth 2.0 protocol.  

- Lab Authoring Tools :: 
The project aimed to create web tools used to create online labs without the
knowledge of coding. I developed the programming model for this, and did a
comparative study of various modeling and game-creation softwares. I also
created a studio, using javascript, where objects can be uploaded, placed, and
moved around.

- Web Security ::
I helped write a paper regarding modeling and mitigating cross origin attacks
on systems using federated identity management. During this I found
vulnerabilities in the logout handler of many sites.


- Internship Experience ::
I had a great time working with others and learning new concepts. The freedom
we got to explore different areas was wonderful and the guidance we received
was of great help. I would definitely recommend people to take up this
internship in the future.
