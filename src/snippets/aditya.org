* Project
  - Experiment as a Service :: The project was to build a platfrom, Vlabs Platform which can be used to serve the content of experiments. The aim was to give freedom of using editors and formats that are more flexible to generate content.

  - Internship Experience :: It was an amazing experience working with VLEAD developers. This was my first internship experience. Working in professional environment was new to me. Mentors and other interns helped me a lot in my project.
