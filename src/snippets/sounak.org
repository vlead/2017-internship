* Project
  - Experiment as a Service :: This project required us to work on the Virtual
       Labs platform. This platform gives developers the freedom of authoring
       the content of the experiments in markup files stored in a Github
       repository. The platform also generates the HTML resources from the
       markup files authored by the developers automatically and hosts them on
       the server.

  - Internship Experience :: This is my first full-time internship experience
       and I am really satisfied with the experience. I have been able to learn
       a lot of subject matter from the mentors and the other interns which has
       helped me tremendously in my project and will also help in projects that
       I take up in future. And I have also learnt to work in a professional
       environment.
