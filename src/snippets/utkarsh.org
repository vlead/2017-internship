* Project
  - Lab Data Service Dashboard
    The project required us to design a user-friendly dashboard for LDS (Lab Data Service) 
    to minimize the userâ€™s efforts in accessing and manipulating data from all the virtual 
    labs. We developed it as an SPA (Single Page Application) just using plain JavaScript 
    without any framework along with JSON specification for view model which was the most 
    challenging part of all.

  - Internship Experience ::This was my first internship experience and was exactly like I 
    wanted it to be. My understanding of the subject and concepts have really grown a lot 
    which is all due to the support of my mentors. I think this has really made me compatible 
    to work in a professional working environment along with giving my best under deadlines 
    which surely gonna help me with my next projects.
