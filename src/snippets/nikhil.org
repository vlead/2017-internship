* Project
  
  - LINUX Lab ::
  This project required us to work on Linux Lab using JS, PYTHON, PHP frameworks. The aim is to build a lab with a terminal emulator on user's browser with a JS layer on top of that to get information about the command outputs using hovering. This Lab also includes a lot of servers integrated together to achieve the goal.    
  - Internship Experience ::
  My internship experience has been an excellent one. I have been able to learn a lot of subject matter from the mentors and the other interns which has helped me tremendously in my project and will also help in projects that I take up in future. I would definitely recommend people to take up this internship in VLEAD.
