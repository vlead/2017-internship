  - Conversion of Virtual Labs from Flash to JavaScript :: 
    The motive of the project is to convert the Virtual Lab experiments from
    Flash to JavaScript. There are some major issues with Flash which prevent
    it from being used widely. Some of them being Accessibility of Flash
    content, its Search Engine Friendliness and issues with Poor degradation.
    Hence creating similar experiences in JavaScript, we can avoid many of the
    problems inherent in Flash. Another benefit with the conversion is pure
    HTML5 /  JavaScript is easier to understand, decompile and re-use. 

  - Internship Experience :: 
    I found my Intern experience to be very helpful in enhancing my
    knowledge. I received good support from my mentors who helped with every
    aspect of the project. The experience made me understand the importance of
    Teamwork and also gain some very important insights of working with senior
    officials. I believe that this experience will help me in taking up
    projects in the future and work effectively in a professional environment.
