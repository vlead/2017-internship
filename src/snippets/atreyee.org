* Project
  - Web App in Haskell :: I worked on projects using functional languages-
       chiefly Haskell - for the duration of this internship. The first project
       comprised of writing a proof-of-concept of a typical web application in
       Haskell, and performing a brief comparison study with equivalent
       software in other languages
  - NLP Tools In Functional Languages :: The second project consisted of
       studying NLP tools in functional languages, and an attempt to rewrite 
       them to fit a Paninian Grammar framework.
 
  - Internship Experience :: My internship experience was extremely
       interesting. I had the chance to work on two of my chief interests -
       functional programming and NLP - and gain experience and knowledge 
       from professors who have worked in these fields.
