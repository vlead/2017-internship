* Project
  - Experiment as a Service :: In this project we were tasked to build a microservice to continuously build, test and deploy any changes made to the code in the Github repository. 

  - Internship Experience :: This is my first internship and I learnt a lot, not just w.r.t to the project but about programming in general, different development tools and using Ubuntu.
