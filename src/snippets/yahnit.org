* Project
  - Lab Data Service Dashboard :: 
    The project's motive was to design a user-friendly dashboard for LDS (Lab Data Service) 
    which contains meta data of all the virtual labs. Our goal was to minimize the userâ€™s 
    efforts in accessing and manipulating data of virtual labs. We developed it as an SPA 
   (Single Page Application). We built it from the scratch using plain JavaScript without 
   any framework along with JSON specification for view model which was the most challenging part of all.


  - Internship Experience :: 
    This is my first internship experience and I strongly felt that i have spent quality 
    time here . I got a clear idea on how things are dealt at the corporate level. 
    I also received tremendous support from all the mentors around me who never hesitated 
    to clear my doubts even though they were very trivial. We were given full freedom to 
    express ourselves and we were not pressurized at any point of time. This experience 
    made me understand the importance of team work and me compatible to work in a professional environment.
