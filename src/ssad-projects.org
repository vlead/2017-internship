* Projects
  - 1. Experiment as a service :: The platform to author, host
       and provide a runtime environment for experiments. 

  - 2. Virtual Labs Portal :: A portal that is dynamically
       built by pulling the data from various services.

  - 3. Lab Authoring Platform :: A platform that allows lab
       authors to quickly put together an experiment by drag
       'n drop of components.

  - 4. Oauth for VLEAD services :: A single sign on for
       various portals at VLEAD and a mechanism for
       different services at VLEAD to communicate with each
       other in a secure way.

  - 5. User Directory :: A light weight web application to
       provide insights to realize automation and
       transformation of a data model to an application.

  - 6. Re-Narration :: A web accessibility inspired semantic
       web framework that takes existing, already published
       web content and facilitates the modification of the
       content, flow, assembly and style of that source for
       re-presentation, re-delivery to a varied user base,
       for the purpose of improving the page (content's)
       accessibility. 
    - Link :: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3047292

  - 7. Lab Data Service Dashboard :: Data driven development
       of a single page application where each page is built
       dynamically from data, read here as a specification
       and therefore is automated.

  - 8. Automate Cluster creation for a certain performance :: Performance
       test bench for all the services in cluster provides
       feedback for configuration.

  - 9. Data Visualization :: A dashboard to view the
       analytics of Virtual Labs. 

  - 10. Data structures lab :: A lab with 10
       experiments illuminating concepts in data
       structures.

  - 11. Systems Dashboard :: A dashboard that displays the
       dynamic and static states of the cluster by
       interacting through a set of API.  The set of end
       points gathers data using system calls.

  - 12. Conversion of virtual experiments :: Convert
       experiments written in Flask, JAVA or other
       proprietary software or experiments that require
       plugins to javascript to allow the same experiments
       to run from a browser.

  - 13. Linux Lab :: A lab with 10 experiments illuminating
       concepts in Linux.
